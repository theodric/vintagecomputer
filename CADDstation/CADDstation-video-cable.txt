The cable is 3 meters long, with a beige rubberized coating covering a shielding braid enclosing three pairs of signal & GND wires. It terminates on one end in a male DB-25 connector populated with 6 crimp-type pins, and on the other with three male BNC connectors. The cable is labeled at the computer end with a wrap-around sticker printed with:

  PRIME
966-00666
ATX 08-89
  COLOR
  VIDEO
  
...and at the monitor end with a similar sticker proclaiming:

  PRIME
966-00666
CA38E0666
  REV.E

The wires in the D-connector are discrete signal and ground wires, white and black respectively, but the wires connecting to the RGB connectors emerge from the cable bundle as ~15cm of thin, flexible core-insulation-braid-outercover type, color coded in red, green, and blue.

Numbering as viewed from the rear/solder side of the DB-25, with 1 being the rightmost, topmost pin (as labeled on the original):

1 - Red signal
2 - Red GND
3 - Green signal
4 - Green GND
5 - Blue signal
6 - Blue GND

Ground planes are not shared between colors, and the outer metal portion of the D-shell is not connected to anything. There are also no connections bridged inside the DB-25.

On my CADDstation, the output of the two-board VME video interface is SOG, IIRC 1152x900, but I don't remember the frequency. This reference seems to support my memory:

I've successfully driven a '91 SGI CM2086A3SG (4D/25's RGB display) and an '06 Dell 2007FP with it, for the latter, using female-female couplers to connect the RGB outputs from the original cable into an RGB-HD15 analog VGA cable.
